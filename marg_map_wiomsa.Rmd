You can read the information from [this link](https://www.jla-data.net/eng/leaflet-in-r-tips-and-tricks/)
Interactive maps are a powerful visualization tool, and the javascript library leaflet.js is a great means to achieving this objective. The {leaflet} package from RStudio makes this library accessible from R.

The package documentation is good, but as the interactive visualization is usually the last step of a complex process I felt the need to share some of my lessons learned.

For this demonstrations I am using a data frame of Marine Research Grants grantee offered by WIOMSA in diffeent countries withinn the WIO region, but the actual choice of points is not that crucial â€“ what I found nice for demonstration purposes is that:

the MARG support are in two three categories
can be grouped to three branches of power
Is for researchers with publications with links to Google scholar

The first step is creating the the data frame and making it feel spatial via the excellent {sf} package. By using a spatial data frame as data object of our leaflet call we are absolved from the need to specify longitude and latitude. This would be hassle (but doable) for points, but next to impossible for polygons.
